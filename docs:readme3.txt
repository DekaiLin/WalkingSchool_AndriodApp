\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hi Rohit\
\
This is Rong Li from Navy group. I am writing this note for you because there is something in our project iteration 3 we need to explain to you. It appears that we cannot upload our lastGpsLocation to the server, we have just found out this bug very close to the due time, it worked fine and able to rewards user a day before, there is not enough time to figure out exactly why, but we suspect there maybe something wrong with the server, because we couldn\'92t edit lastGpsLocation from the web interface that Brain provided neither. Please kindly consider this situation. \
\
Thank you very much\
