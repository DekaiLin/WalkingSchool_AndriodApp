Project iteration 3

  This is Rong Li from Navy group.  It appears that we cannot upload our lastGpsLocation to the server, we have just found out this bug close to the due time. It worked fine and able to rewards user a day before, but there is not enough time to figure out exactly why. We suspect there maybe something wrong with the server, because we couldn\'92t edit lastGpsLocation from the web interface that Brain provided neither. Please kindly consider this situation. \

Thank you very much\
